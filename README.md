#Project: Load Camera:
The app functions as a basic camera viewer. It is inteded for use to check access rights on Android. 
Currently the app is only tested on Android 13 - Pixel 7 Pro. There is currently an issue with Maui supporting Android 13 when trying to access the camera or file system to load an image. In order to work around that the target android version is set to android 13.

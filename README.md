A repo for MAUI Tests and tutorials to live in

# Project: Load Camera:
The app functions as a basic camera viewer. It is inteded for use to check access rights on Android. 
Currently the app is only tested on Android 13 - Pixel 7 Pro. There is currently an issue with Maui supporting Android 13 when trying to access the camera or file system to load an image. In order to work around that the target android version is set to android 13.
The app is also tested on macOs and works as expected.

# Project: ResizableRectGraphics
The app displays a Rectangle on the screen. The rectangle can be resized by the user either by using the mouse or using touch. Simply touch the edge of the rectangle and start moving it around. The project also implements the MVVM pattern.
